# Modules

Some call it partials. I call it modules. Taken on some principle from [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/), this is where we break things down into much finer categories like (typography, buttons, forms, ect). Feel free add/remove sasssheets as needed.

```
|– _animation.scss        # Custom CSS Animations
|– _base.scss             # This is where we define some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements
|– _buttons.scss          # Buttons
|– _typography.scss       # Typography
|– _forms.scss            # Forms
|– _helper.scss           # Helper classes
|– _mediaqueries.scss     # Custom mediaqueries
|– _print.scss            # Print styles
…                         # Etc.
```

Or add up whatever you feel is needed
