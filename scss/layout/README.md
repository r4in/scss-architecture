# Layout

The `layout/` folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the site or application. This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts of the site (header, footer, navigation, sidebar…), the grid system or even CSS styles for all the forms.

\_footer.scss - Footer styles
\_header.scss - Header styles

Or add up whatever you feel is needed
